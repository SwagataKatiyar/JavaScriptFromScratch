//we can change variable type from one to another but this can't happen in other laguages and they throw error.

var a= 67; //var is used to declare a variable
console.log(a);
a= "Swagata";
console.log(a);

let a= 64; //Here, 64 is literal (constant value), "=" is assignment operator, "let" is used to declare and variable and a is a "identifier" 

/* Rules: 
1. Must begin with a $, _ or a letter. 
eg: let 8harry = 7 // Not allowed this because of indetifier is staring with number.

2. We can't use reserved words
3. JS is case sensitive
