What is Javascript?

-JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate
images, and pretty much everything else. 

The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

1) Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.

2) Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and 
then run the code that updates the text label.
